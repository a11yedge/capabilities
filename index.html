		        <h2>Abstract</h2>
			<p>Lately various web based accessibility enhancement, remediation, and reporting services have been made available to web content providers under an umbrella term: <q>Overlay.</q>
			Typically overlays work by adding a snippet of JavaScript into a web content provider&apos;s page. This single line of additional code functions to enable additional content processing on each page load delivered through
			the overlay provider&apos;s servers,  prior to delivery to the end user. While this routing paradigm is by no means unique to accessibility applications, it does introduce accessibility opportunities and
			challenges.</p>

			<p>In this document we explore the specific capabilities that are, or could be,  applied for accessibility purposes whether by overlay technologies, browser extensions, plugins installed on user&apos;s devices or by other methods and tools. Some of the capabilities explored here are already available and used in web content delivery systems today. Others suggest best practices guidance. Still others strike us as highly desirable, but will require the creation of a normative W3C specification, especially in the case of cross-platform functionality. As with any web technology, poor design or implementation will predictably yield unsatisfactory user experiences, while well-architected and well-implemented solutions will significantly enhance the user&apos;s experience.</p>

	<section id="edgedef">
		<h3>What is Meant By <q>Edge?</q></h3>

		<p>In this document the term <q>edge technology</q> refers to those web technologies most proximate to the web user that canstill affect the accessibility of assembled (mashed-up) web content. Typically it is:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>The user agent (with its user chosen plugins and extensions) together with the host and physical device the user uses to read and interact with web content;</li>
			<li>But more powerfully (as we shall soon see), it is the last compositor of content delivered to the user. It is of course cloud-based. And, while it might not be geographically proximate to the user, it functions most powerfully when it functions as the user&apos;s proxy agent for organizing web content in the manner the user is best able to use.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>Both of these are privileged positions providing access to much information about the user and how the user functions. While we note the need to preserve the web user&apos;s privacy here, the remainder of this document focusses on providing accessibility support and assumes privacy is preserved through mechanisms detailed in other W3C technologies.

	        <h3>Potential for Autonomous Automation</h3>

		  <p>In the subsections titled “Potential for Autonomous Automation,” we pragmatically evaluate the extent to which automation, supported through AI and Machine Learning, can operate autonomously to detect, remediate, and verify without the need for human interaction for each listed capability.</p>

</p>It’s crucial to understand the distinction between autonomous automation involving AI or Machine Learning that is identified here and the broader application of AI and automation as tools that assist humans in the Accessibility process, which in itself can influence the quality of any team addressing these capabilities. This subsection aims to solely focus on giving an indication of the likely potential using the following comments in that subsection.</p>

</p>In many cases - indicated that in many cases of this type of capability, Autonomous Automation could be used successfully to achieve acceptable results.</p>

</p>In some cases - indicated that in some cases, depending on the way capabilities have been implemented, Autonomous Automation could be used successfully to achieve acceptable results.</p>

</p>In no significant way - indicated that there are currently no cases of this type of capability where Autonomous Automation would generate acceptable results.</p>

</p>By grounding our discussion in this practical approach, we align with the abstract’s themes of opportunities and challenges presented by new technologies in enhancing web accessibility.</p>

	        <h3>Web Content Today is Dynamic</h3>

		  <p>In the main the classic paradigm of a web domain owner serving content directly to end users across the Internet has long ago become a historical artifact.
		    Today&apos;s typical web page is often a dizzying composite of multiple content streams injected from various sources, including content unique to the user&apos;s locale and even to the specific user herself. Content
		    delivered to a user today may be a unique <q>one-off</q> composite that may well change when the page is refreshed. The <a href="https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2021/third-parties">2021 Web Almanac</a> notes more
		    than 20 third party injection streams for today&apos;s typical web site, with 10% containing over 90 separate content injections.</p>

		    <p>The source of the typical website
		    today is actually many sources.

		    Even bespoke web applications aren&apos;t always created by a single
		    source. Few developers exclusively use their own code. They rely on
		    libraries, components and frameworks to build their web content.</p>
		    
		    <p> Edge technologies may actually be best placed to help overcome the problem
		    of substandard accessibility in composite content delivered to end users by identifying precisely the accessibility challenges that end users may experience and helping remediate them where it matters most&mdash;at the user
		    level, for the simple reason that technology based tracking and reporting can examine far more end user payload deliveries than human testing will ever cover. In particular we consider the role played by various edge-based players beginning with the Content Delivery Network (CDN), the operating system on the user&apos;s devices, user-agent, browser extensions, assistive technologies, and/or JavaScript overlays.  Whether the resulting remediation is an in-process transformation,
		    or an upstream recoding, gathering and reporting many samples to upstream end points is arguably the most efficient way to spot anomalous patterns (and a great application for A-I analysis).</p>

			<h3>About This Document</h3>

	     <p>This document describes some capabilities important to web content accessibility that can be provided <q>at the edge</q>, and attempts to answer several questions about them. The questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Source: What is the role of the author (or content source code developer) in providing this capability and ensuring that it is accessible?</li>

<li>Trade-offs: When this capability is enabled on the edge, does it duplicate functionality elsewhere in the stack? When we find  redundancies, we ask whether they can and should be avoided?</li>

<li>Benefit: What is the potential benefit of performing this capability at the edge?</li>

<li>Related topics: Draw attention to capabilities that are related in some way, e.g. perhaps they&apos;re mutually enhancing, or perhaps they are the prospective benefit of a normative cross-platform behavior specification.</li>
</ul>

	<p>The capabilities discussed are organized under two primary categories with several subcategories under each primary section. This two-poled approach conforms with client-server architecture, the backbone of all digital transactions and interactions that take place over the Internet. The primary categories are:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Capabilities the end user can (or should) be able to control fully.</li>
		<li>Capabilities which are necessarily controlled by the content provider even though they can profoundly affect the accessibility experience.</li>
	</ul>

<p>The Content Provider, analogous to the server, plays the pivotal role of specifying and delivering diverse forms of digital content ranging from text, images, audio, video, to interactive elements. They curate the experiences that users consume and engage with, thereby shaping the digital landscape.

A selection of some primary Content Provider roles:
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Role</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Author</td>
    <td>Responsible for generating the primary content, be it text, script for audio/video, or conceptual outlines for interactive elements.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Designer</td>
    <td>Work on the aesthetic aspects of the content including the layout, color scheme, typography, and visual elements. They also handle the user interface and user experience design for interactive content.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Product Owner</td>
    <td>Oversee the overall content creation and distribution project, make key decisions and coordinate between different teams to ensure the final product meets its intended objectives.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Developer</td>
    <td>Implement the designs into functional code. They work on the website or application where the content will be hosted, ensuring its responsive, functional, and accessible. Some write proprietary algorithms, but most call and configure frameworks and libraries written by communities of coders.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Marketer</td>
    <td>Oversee and implement the marketing strategy for the content. They coordinate marketing campaigns and work closely with other teams to ensure the content reaches the desired audience. Growth marketers utilize data-driven marketing techniques to help the business expand its customer base. They use various strategies and tools to attract, engage, and retain users driving critical website requirements.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


<p>On the other end of the spectrum is the End User, or the client, who experiences this digital content. End users span a wide range, varying in their demographic, cognitive, and physical attributes. They also bring to the table their unique needs, preferences, and accessibility requirements. It is for these users that content providers shape their digital content and experiences, with or without the knowledge that the user&apos;
s own hardware and software may render it in ways the Content Provider never imagined. </p>

<P>Content sites are inherently dynamic; they are assembled for the end-user in a mashup, a unique blend of content that can vary significantly from user to user. A selection of some of the hardware, software, tools and technologies that participate in this edge activity include:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Technology</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>User-Agent (Browser)</td>
    <td>Interprets and presents web content to the end user. Different browsers may render web content in slightly different ways due to their different rendering engines.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Assistive Technology</td>
    <td>Devices or software applications that assist individuals with disabilities or impairments. This could include screen readers, alternative input devices, and voice recognition software.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Browser Extension</td>
    <td>An add-on or plugin that extends the functionality of a web browser. Could alter the appearance of web content, block advertisements, or add additional features to a webpage. Includes mashup tools or web services that combine content from more than one source into a single integrated experience. These can greatly modify the original content and how it is presented to the user.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>OS or Software Application</td>
    <td>A program or group of programs running on the local operating system. Applications can vary drastically in purpose, from productivity apps to entertainment apps, and can influence how digital content is accessed and interacted with.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Video/Audio System</td>
    <td>Hardware and software components that control the output of video and sound.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Content Delivery Network</td>
    <td>Store copies of web content in various locations around the world to reduce the physical distance between the server and the user, improving site performance. This intermediary, typically invisible to the end user, plays a critical role in delivery and updating of digital content, as well as authenticating users.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


<p>This two-poled digital communication model is not a one-way broadcast, but a dynamic conversation. Feedback from end users can influence and improve the content generated by providers, while content providers continuously adapt their strategies based on user behavior and needs. The feedback loops become more complex as edge technologies come into play.

<h1>Presentation&mdash;Usually CSS</h1>

<p>

The capabilities discussed in this section are afforded users to facilitate content rerendering utilizing presentational characteristics each individual user finds most accomodative. These are accommodations that allow users to <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/intro#understanding-the-four-principles-of-accessibility">perceive and understand</a> <a href="#manage">published content and services</a For persons with print disabilities these capabilities starkly illustrate the superior accessibility of web content over printed media, because printed media cannot be similarly accomodating. Whatever <q>look and feel</q> a content provider may have chosen and published, the user&apos;s adaptations must necessarily take precedence for reasons of accessibility. To put it in other words: <q>The author proposes, but the user disposes.</q></p>
<p>In the main presentation is achieved with css. We have a strong preference for css in presentation rendering because css is most fungible. Rendering the presentation layer through technologies other than css is highly likely to prove inaccessible and require remediation into css in order to support accessibility requirements as defined by W3C.</p>

	<h2>Structural Semantics Remediation</h2>

	<p>WCAG explains in painstaking detail the critical importance to accessibility of structural markup. It is a fundamental requirement and any means to remediate or improve missing structural markup provides an immediate functional enhancement to users whose accessibility accommodations rely on explicit structural semantics.</p>

<section id="structure">
	<h3>Expose Structural Semantics</h3>

<dl>
<dt>Source</dt>
<dd>
It has long been agreed that published content should contain structural markup as provided by HTML and explained by WCAG. Not only is this critical for accessibility, additional processing to further tailor content presentation to particular user needs will rely on proper structural markup, preferably provided by source content.
</dd>
<dt>Trade-offs</dt>
<dd>
	There is no inherent value to creating structural markup in edge technology. Doing so is clearly a remedial action to close a critical gap. On the other hand and as previously noted content delivered to end users today is most frequently a composite mashup of multiple input streams and not the simple delivery of content from a single source repository. The very act of mashing together multiple streams introduces a likelihood of semantic incoherency. The very word itself, <q>mashup,</q> strongly suggests a lack of concern for the coherency of the ultimate composite as delivered to the end user. Thus, anything that can be done to introduce greater semantic coherency is of benefit to all users, and especially those users relying on accessibility supporting features such as coherent and explicit structure. Lastly, as also previously noted, emerging strategies to further tailor content interaction to particular user&apos;s interaction preferences will rely on good structural markup, and these adaptations will, necessarily, be produced in edge technologies.
</dd>
<dt>Benefit</dt>
<dd>
	Whether as a temporary remedial expedient or the advanced personalization adaptation now emerging from W3C accessibility standards, or somewhere in between, users simply deserve the best structural semantics that can be provided them in the moment when they seek to interact with web content. Any and all philosophical <q>should</q> arguments must give way to this simple rubric.
</dd>
</dl>

</section>

<section id="structnorm">
	<h3>Normalize the Structural Composite</h3>

	<p>
	Many users with accessibility needs rely heavily on consistency in the user interface. Yet no standard exists, nor is likely ever to require certain common controls be located consistently across sites. This is very much in the design prerogative of the individual content publisher. And, while individual sites may be fully consistent in where they locate controls on the pages they publish, the user who comparison shops will encounter a different site consistently locating the same controls differently. The publisher has done nothing wrong, but the user is forced to rely on a perfect memory or put up with time-consuming strategies for locating these controls. Consider this example:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The user needs to make a reservation on a travel site and will shop several sites to compare offers.</li>
		<li>Necessarily this involves picking (or specifying) dates.</li>
		<li>Typically a starting date is specified first.</li>
		<li>At this point the user needs to locate the control for switching to the specification of the end date.</li>
		<li>Where is it on this site? Is it at the upper right? The lower left? Some other location on screen on this particular site which is different from other sites the user has searched?</li>
		<li>Note that that swiping on a touch-screen may easily miss encountering these controls, especially when swiping forward into future dates. Swiping focus will remain in the date-picker widget</li>
		<li>Searching for these controls risks activating a control irrelevant to the current task such as a notification screen. This further complicates the user&apos;s predicament and wastes yet more of the user&apos;s time.</li>
	</ul>

<dl>
<dt>Source</dt>
<dd>
	By definition this conundrum cannot be resolved by a source content publisher.
</dd>
<dt>Trade-offs</dt>
<dd>
	None. Only an edge technology can hope to ameliorate the situation.
</dd>

<dl>

<dd>
	The means of navigation is not offered by source. 
</dd>
<dt>Trade-offs</dt>

	This additional navigation aide would not block or hinder other types of access; the only trade-off could be confusion of having an excessive number of choices. Having a sheer volume of options can be mentally exhausting to some. 
</dd>
<dt>Benefit</dt>
<dd>The "curb cut effect" is used to describe a situation where accommodations made to assist people with disabilities end up benefiting everyone. The ability to browse pages by structural semantic features such as headings, links, or buttons promises to allow users to quickly move between different sections or elements of a web page without the need to visually scan the entire page. This can save time, especially on long and complex pages with lots of content. By using semantic navigation options like headings or links, sighted users can easily jump to specific sections or pieces of content they are interested in. This can be particularly helpful when users are looking for specific information or trying to locate a particular topic on a page. 
	<p>Some users rely on keyboard navigation alone, such as those with motor disabilities or certain types of visual impairments.

<h3>Form Labels</h3>

		<p>Forms are the fundamental interface of the interactive web.

Furthermore, consistent grouping and form controls on screen location is also critical.</p>

		<dl>
		<dt>Source</dt>
		<dd>
		Far too many sites fail to use available markup to associate date entry fields and status selection control widgets with the labels the print to screen. These sites expect non-disabled users will simply understand what label applies to what field and widget by virtue of how the two are printed to screen. The user who relies on programmatic association is thus disadvantaged. The problem is amplified by the use and re-use of frameworks and low code forms that lack this support.
		</dd>

<h3>Only The Edge Knows For Sure</h3>

  <p>While some rare web pages serve up a single experience like a short order cook handing over a burger, most are like the food court at a shopping mall with many independent services rallying to the end user&apos;s needs. Content providers pack their pages with services such as cookie permissions, chat, payment gateways, user-generated reviews, and most prolifically advertisements. 
	<dl>
		<dt>Source</dt>
		<dd>Content providers can only guess at an end user&apos;s experience by testing well chosen scenarios. Large organizations may arrange focus groups that give a glimpse of a few users, at one moment in time. But in the end, almost by definition, the source cannot know. </dd>

		<dt>Trade-offs</dt>
		<dd>Persons with disabilities tend to be concerned about content
			providers discovering and monetizing user data. 
			Their lived reality has made
			them highly desirous to preserve their privacy 
			because of perceived and actual
			experience of discrimination over many years. Privacy assurances, along with steep privacy violation fines, can build trust over time, such as that supporting the nearly ubiquitous use of Google Analytics at the edge.</dd>

		<dt>Benefit</dt>
		<dd>Sampling and monitoring the accessibility of the user experience can only occur at the moment of user access because only the edge knows for sure. Much as a thermostat should be positioned far from the heat source, to measure the temperature of the room, monitoring at the edge is the only way to determine what is happening there. </dd>

		<h3>Fully Automated Transformations</h3>

		  <p>Automated transformations applied based on conditions edge technology discovers in the user&apos;s technology.
			</p>

			<dl>
				<dt>Source</dt>
				<dd>Content providers have long sought to tailor UX behavior based on what capabilities could be discovered about the user&apos;s operating environment. What browser is in use? Desktop, mobile or smart watch? Is a screen reader in use? Indeed, <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/turingtest/#recap3">Google&apos;s automated Recaptcha 3 is deeply dependent on just such data gathering</a>.
				</dd>

				<dt>Trade-offs</dt>
				<dd>While a well-crafted remediation
					  technology may be invisible to users, it is both
						risky and presumptuous to presume there will be no users who will not
						experience some kind of accessibility challenge even among the best crafted remediation technologies. Matters are made worse when the user is left uninformed and feels a loss of agency. 
		        </dd>

							<dt>Benefit</dt>
							<dd>Users do indeed expect their technologies will operate automatically and seamlessly to provide an accessible and functional experience. This is an accepted technological expectation. Content providers do not err in
								attempting to meet this expectation. 
								An automated UX transformation approach can provide clear benefits. One example is real-time applications such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/raur/">Real Time Communications (RTC)</a>.
			        Immediacy matters. Automated captions may not provide the desired quality, but the alternative may too often be no captions whatsoever.
				        Similarly missing image descriptions generated by A-I may prove more helpful to the user coping with a substandard page than no alternative text at all.
					        Pages whose content remains unremediated can also tend to encourage users to seek alternative providers.

<h3>Human Mediated Automated Remediation</h3>

		<p>While not the glamorous <q>holy grail</q> of technology deployment today, human mediation of A-I identified checkpoints, together with the site owner&apos;s active participation to clarify meaning and intent, describes an effective approach to accomplish accessibility remediations where they&apos;re needed.

<h3>Feature-Bundling Profiles</h3>

<p>Site publishers need to support the full spectrum of accessibility features. On the other hand individual users need certain features and will ignore those they do not need. The types of features individual users need are  often group-able

		<h2>Personalized & Portable Configuration Profiles</h2>

<h3>Configure Once, Use Everywhere</h3>

<p>Users now frequently use several devices. Furthermore, users tend to have the same or very similar accessibility requirements regardless of the device they may be using in the moment. 
	It is therefore an emerging goal in web accommodations to support the user in configuring once and having their configured preference propagate across all their devices. Such a cross-Device preference profile should ideally function across all vendors and operating environments.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Source</dt>
<dd>While technically feasible in source, this is not being done by content source today, and we are not aware of any proposals to add such functionality in content source&mdash;likely for a multiplicity of reasons.

	Such a capability has long been desired and is arguably now more achievable than ever before. 
	It would  clearly be valuable to users. 
	For example, blind users and people on slow internet connections will benefit from setting their browsers to not download images. 
	It will nevertheless require nuanced implementation, e.g.  screen size and consequent decisions over preferred fonts, spacing, and contrasts  will likely vary by screen size and environmental conditions.

		<h1>Appendices</h1>

        <section class="appendix" id="Appendix-A">
		<h2>Design Principles</h2>

<p>Our approach to the design and analysis in this document is rooted in the principles often called: <q>Human-Centered
Design (HCD).</q> As an outlook that places people at its core, we believe HCD  aligns perfectly with the goals of accessibility. This method of design prioritizes empathy, collaboration, and user empowerment, which aligns with
our mission to generate accessibility solutions that meet the diverse needs of various human individuals. Our understanding of HCG requires us to minimize technological configuration tasks and maximize each individual&apos;s ability to read and interact with actual content&mdash;not the application (or browser) <q>chrome.</q></p>

		<p>Among various design terminologies linked with accessibility such as
		<q>universal design</q> and <q>inclusive design,</q> HCD sets itself apart due to some
		specific distinct attributes, such as:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>A focus on Individual Needs:</strong> HCD underscores the importance of comprehending
		the unique needs, preferences, and behaviors of individual users. It
		acknowledges that effective design solutions must address the broad
		spectrum of the human experience, catering to the specific requirements of
		different individuals. At the same time our goal is to allow individual users to focus on the features that assist them without needing to endlessly scroll through features that are the needs of other individuals.</li>

			<li><strong>User Empowerment:</strong> Central to the HCD approach is the active involvement of
		users throughout the design process. This approach appreciates their
		expertise, insights, and encourages co-creation, thereby fostering a sense
		of ownership and agency over the final outcome. As an example, in developing this document we actively solicit the input of individuals on whose behalf we endeavor to quantify and describe useful accessibility features. As with all W3C documents, transparency and wide public review are core values.</li>
		</ul>

<p>Our design philosophy does not merely aim for inclusivity; instead, it
		strives to create meaningful experiences that significantly enhance the
		lives of the people we serve. A successful application of HCD manifests not
		just in broad-reaching accessibility, but in generating rich, meaningful,
		and transformative experiences for the user.</p>

<p>Furthermore, HCD endeavors to build a comprehensive understanding of the
end user, transcending the confines of mere accessibility. It delves into
the emotional, cognitive, and social dimensions of the human experience,
with a commitment to design solutions that resonate on a profoundly
personal level.</p>

<p>Our commitment to HCD is woven throughout our efforts to ensure
accessibility. In prioritizing a user&apos;s individual needs and emphasizing
their active involvement in the design process, we believe we can create a
more accessible and inclusive digital environment. By employing HCD, we
hope to deliver a seamless, enjoyable experience for all users, that is
more than just accessible - it is truly human-centered.</p>

<h3>User-triggered Transformations</h3>

<p>User can be afforded  the opportunity to opt-in to various transformations via interactive personalization menus: The end-user can access a list of available enhancements and enable those they require. </p>

<dl>
<dt>Source</dt>
<dd>Users tend to require the same types of accommodations across all sites and all content sources. Therefore, facilitating this capability in the source is likely the least useful place to locate it, because that would require the user to select the same enhancements time and again across the succession of sites visited and likely with different menu organization site to site. </dd>

<dt>Trade-offs</dt>
<dd>Many of the capabilities made available by user-triggered opt-ins are often also found in multiple places at the edge. For example, contrast adjustment is generally found  in operating system display settings, in browser and app user-agents (e.g. dark mode/light mode), and in browser extensions, and in JavaScripted (CDN hosted) overlays. Such redundancy can easily lead to confusion. This confusion may be further exacerbated because certain settings the user finds helpful may be available only in one of these locations, and not in all of them. Furthermore, users are frequently not particularly knowledgeable about their operating system settings menus, especially as these tend to move with each OS revision (to take one example). This can make it difficult to locate these features, especially when we recognize that once satisfactorily configured they are generally not reset (meaning that the user doesn&apos;t need to revisit that menu location and soon forgets where it is). On the other hand, locating the accommodation consistently proximate to the user offers the highest likelihood of maximal benefit provided  the accommodation  can be easily identified and invoked. This also provides the best opportunity for easing the burden of invoking the same accommodation across a user&apos;s multiple devices.</dd>

<dt>Benefit</dt>
<dd>Users can select and optimally tune the types of accommodations that they require. Any device on the edge may also have knowledge of other devices on the edge, that may need the same adjustments, and edge technology could propagate these settings to those other devices.
