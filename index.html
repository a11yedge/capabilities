		        <h2>Abstract</h2>

	<p>This document examines the  trade offs and benefits of dynamic accessibility
remediations applied to web content in real-time to deliver accessible web
experiences. A systematic approach is used to evaluate numerous atomic functional <q>capabilities.</q>
 ranging from alternative text and personalized visual
presentation to interactive components. The outcome of the trade-offs and benefits evaluation is cross-referenced to WCAG for each capability.
Each capability is also assessed for automation
based on the presence of
	programmatically recognizable patterns conducive to automated adaptation.
The technological approaches considered include the same HTML, CSS, and JavaScripted
adaptations commonly used today achieving in-source accessibility, but effected dynamically in content delivery pipelines
and browser extensions, all without requiring additional on-screen widgets.
	Management and maintenance concerns, as well as
forward-looking capabilities, are addressed using the same systematic trade-offs and benefits approach.  A closing
discussion articulates our human-centered design principles and an appendix
clarifies responsibilities across the ecosystem.

		     <h2>Scope</h2>

<p>
What seems to be a single web page to most users today is actually anything but that.
Today&apos;s world wide web is a complex blend of multiple original sources, mediated by server-side code to deliver a cohesive user experience. It is the result of a design and development process yielding experiences that work well for some users but fail for others, especially when <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> standards and best practices are indifferently engineered or inconsistently applied. This leaves many websites and online applications inaccessible to people with disabilities.</p>

<p>
The current remedial approach for addressing this accessibility failure requires that developers update source code to conform with accessibility standards more closely. While we certainly support optimizing in-source accessibility, modifying the original code may not always be feasible. It&apos;s also often the least efficient way to deliver different personalized experiences to different individual users. Furthermore, it can be viewed as too time-consuming and costly by business owners.</p>

<p id="diagram">
This document explores how various real-time post-source adaptations can deliver accessible user experiences&mdash;and more varied accessible experiences&mdash;all without
requiring changes to the original source.
		     The diagram below illustrates where the adaptations discussed in this publication fit within a typical server and client data flow:</p>
<ol type="I">
	<li>Initially, 
<ol type="A">
	<li>The content to be rendered to the user, together  with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code is sourced. This is the <q>source</q> layer, though as noted above it&apos;s generally many sources, and not a single source.
	</li>
        <li>Various adaptations may be applied to address specific accessibility needs for the content user&mdash;the first layer of post-source adaptation.
	</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
			<li>Finally, the completed mashup is delivered to the end user for rendering and
				interaction with the end user&apos;s device tools,
				such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/components/">the browser and perhaps also some
					assistive technology</a>&mdash;the last layer of post-source adaptation.
			</li>
</ol>

					<figcaption>Fundamental Diagram of Data Flow</figcaption>
</figure>

					<p>The diagram represents the flow of digital content and code from its origin to the user.
					All entities in the diagram are drawn as clouds, except for the source and the user, who are represented by rectangles. This distinction is intentional.</p>
					<br>
					<ul>
			<li><em>Source Rectangle &amp; Post-Source Clouds:</em> Represent multiple contributors  accessed via <abbr title="Universal Resource Locator">URL</abbr> or <abbr title="Universal Resource Identifier">URI</abbr> whose provenance may not be clear to the user.</li>
							<li><em>Rectangle:</em> The user is represented as a rectangle to illustrate a clear, defined entity&mdash;the person receiving and interacting with the final content, on that person&apos;s devices. The user is the recipient of the final mashup of all modifications
	and adaptations.</li>
					</ul>
						<p><strong>Source (Content/Code):</strong> At the top, the source is where content and code originate. This could be a website, application, or other digital platform. A thick line descends from here representing the main data flow,
						while post-source modifications join along the way, merging with the thick line, affecting the final experience.</p>
						<br>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Post-Source Additions:</strong> As the content/code travels to the user, post-source modifications can be added. These are categorized into two types:</li>

						<ol>
							<li><em>Source-Authorized:</em> These modifications are controlled or approved by the website owner. Examples include third-party scripts and or content delivery network (CDN) assets.</li>
								<li><em>User-Authorized:</em> These adaptations are added by the user, without website  involvement or approval. Examples include browser extensions, antivirus filters, and custom scripts.</li>
						</ol>
						<li><strong>User Additions: </strong>At the bottom, the user receives and interacts with the final <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mash-up">mashed-up</a> digital content on their own devices and affordances. Examples include the browser, user agent, assistive technologies (AT) on a laptop or desktop computer, and also on a smart phone, and perhaps also on a tablet, perhaps also cast to a wall-mounted video display and perhaps also several surround-sound speakers.</li>

		<h2>What is Meant By <q>Edge?</q> and <q>Post-Source</q></h2>

		<p>In this document the term <q>edge technology</q> refers to technologies closer to the user. Often, it&apos;s the technology directly in the user&apos;s hands. Or, it may reside on a content delivery network (CDN) server--in the <q>Source Authorized</q> domain (as diagrammed above)&mdash;where content is actively being personalized for the user. The terms <q>post-source</q> and <q>edge</q> are essentially synonymous. We use the term <q>edge</q> especially to emphasize that it is the user&apos;s experience that really matters when considering accessibility, rather than where in the data flow remediation is effected.</p>
	</section>
	<section id="overlays">
		<h2>Post-Source &amp; Overlays</h2>

		<p>
Two recent actions by the  U.S. Government have referred to the term <q>overlays.</q> First a 
<a href="https://www.w3.org/community/a11yedge/2024/12/06/u-s-attorney-general-on-overlays-cites-community-group-work/">regulatory ruling by the U.S. Attorney-General</a> 
referenced an earlier version of this publication. More recently, 
<a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/01/ftc-order-requires-online-marketer-pay-1-million-deceptive-claims-its-ai-product-could-make-websites">the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (<abbr title="Federal Trade Commission">FTC</abbr>)</a>
issued a consent decree against a vendor, citing certain advertising claims in the marketing of a product called an <q>overlay.</q></p>

		<p>While <q>overlay</q> is not a precisely defined term in either of these documents, in both cases the term is used to describe post-source implementations that modify the presentation or behavior of published web content in real-time,
often by injected
			    scripts and a visible on-screen button.
			    These implementations share some techniques with the approaches documented in this publication, but they represent only a subset of the broader post-source methods we discuss here.</p>


<p>It is essential that vendors who are marketing products and services based on post-source technologies clearly communicate
the scope and limitations of their approach. Forthright representation is also essential for building
trust. Vendors marketing approaches such as those discussed in this document should carefully and
transparently articulate what their technologies and approaches can genuinely deliver. The criteria of the internationally accepted <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">WCAG Success Criteria</a> are cross-referenced throughout this document because they remain valid whether applied in source or post-source through dynamic enhancements.

		<h2><q>Capabilities</q> &amp; WCAG&apos;s Outcomes</h2>

<p>
Our focus is user-centered and outcome-driven. We refer to each potential remediation as a <q>capability</q> because our topic in this document is the technical, post-source intervention; but, we are mindful that such post-source remediations are performed in order to
serve the user&apos;s success&mdash;which is the true outcome. Wherever a capability is described, it should be understood as a means of delivering a concrete, successful accessibility outcome, especially in cases where the source
experience would otherwise fail.
</p>

		<p>
The wide range of specific web accessibility outcomes
sought in this document can be accomplished through the application of appropriate post-source methods.
without recourse to additional UI elements such as pop-up control panels or
<q>accessibility widgets.</q> Indeed the same technologies and methods applied in-source&mdash;HTML, CSS, and JavaScript&mdash;also constitute the post-source toolkit. There is no post-source technology available only to post-source, and there is no in-source method post-source may not appropriate.</p>

			<h2>Our Rationale: Multiple Sources &amp; Individual Users</h2>

		  <p>In the main, the classic paradigm of a web domain serving content directly to end users across the Internet has long ago become a historical artifact.
		    Today&apos;s typical web page is a dizzying composite of multiple content streams injected from various sources, including content unique to the user&apos;s locale and even to the specific user. Content
		    delivered to a user today may be a unique <q>one-off</q> composite that may well change when the page is refreshed. The <a href="https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2021/third-parties">2021 Web Almanac</a> notes more
		    than 20 third-party injection streams for today&apos;s typical website, with 10% containing over 90 separate content injections.</p>

		    <p>The source of the typical website
		    today is actually many sources.
		    Even bespoke web applications aren&apos;t always created by a single
		    source. Few developers exclusively use their own code. They rely on
		    libraries, components and frameworks to build their web content.</p>
		    
		    <p>None of this should surprise us. The fundamental nature of hypertext almost demands the behavior. It illustrates how appropriate the term <q>web</q> actually is for describing the environment.</p>

		<aside class="Note" title="Note" aria-label="Note">
					                <span>Note</span>
									<div>
<p>It&apos;s important to acknowledge that personalizing content for individual
users risks disclosing personal information that the user might prefer not to
	disclose.  Persons with disabilities tend to be concerned about content
	providers discovering and monetizing user data with edge services such
		as the nearly ubiquitous <a
			href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/">Google
			Analytics</a>.</p>

<p>While we strongly support preserving user privacy, this document focuses on accessibility and
	assumes privacy is protected according to <a
		href="https://www.w3.org/TR/privacy-principles/">W3C Privacy
		Principles</a> and related privacy-preserving technologies such
as <a href="https://solidproject.org/">Solid</a>.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Content&mdash;Usually HTML</li>
				<li>Presentation&mdash;Usually CSS</li>

				<h3>How We Evaluate Each Capability</h3>

						<p>Each capability we examine is considered from the following perspectives:</p>

<ol>
<li>Source&mdash;Identifies how the original source code can introduce accessibility issues that require remediation.
</li>

<li>Trade-Offs&mdash;Examines the implications of performing remediation post-source, including potential redundancies or limitations compared to fixing issues in-source.
</li>

	<li>Benefit&mdash;Highlights the accessibility improvements delivered to end users and any added control they gain from post-source adaptation.
	</li>

<li>Automatability&mdash;Evaluates whether the capability can be automated based on the presence of programmatically recognizable patterns conducive to automated adaptation.
</li>

</ol>

		<aside class="Note" title="Note" id="automate" aria-label="Note">
					                <span>Note</span>
									<div>

										<p><strong>About Automatability:</strong> We evaluate the <q>Automatability</q> of each capability accordingly:</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>In many cases</em> &mdash; Suggesting that automation can successfully remediate and verify outcomes across a broad set of websites.</li>
	<li><em>In some cases</em> &mdash; Pointing to potential success in specific implementations where the variables, website structures and code are well-understood and controlled.</li>
	<li><em>In no significant way</em> &mdash; Indicating scenarios where current automation strategies are unlikely to be effective without significant human oversight.</li>
	<li><em>Does Not Apply</em>&mdash;Is sometimes indicated for completeness.</li>
</ul>

<p>We take a pragmatic approach to evaluating the potential for
		automation, emphasizing the fundamental role of pre-existing
		technical systems that can detect issues and suggest solutions.
		These approaches utilize algorithms and rules developed from prior
		experience to predict, assess, and remediate code structures
		effectively. Today, this necessarily relies on thorough human-generated rules and algorithms
		rather than A-I and Machine Learning (ML).</p>
		 
<p>We emphasize that our use of the term <q>automatability</q> does not imply a self-generating nor
a spontaneously adaptive system. Rather, it
refers to the capacity to apply these established rules and
algorithms across multiple environments predictably.
Human oversight remains critical to achieve comprehensive accessibility in most situations today. While automation and A-I can help, we should not expect these can replace humans entirely. Human remediation of A-I identified checkpoints, together with the content creator&apos;s active participation to clarify meaning and intent remains our preferred approach to accomplish accessibility remediation.

	<h3>Provide Alternative Text</h3>

	<p>Alternative text is a fundamental and well established accessibility accommodation (dating to the era of HTML 3.2). No good reason for missing alt text remains, yet far too many sites are missing alt text today.</p>

	<aside class="wcag2x" title="WCAG Reference" aria-label="WCAG Reference">

<dl>
<dt>Source</dt>
<dd>
WCAG has always expected sites would supply alternative text for all images&mdash;yet missing alt text is still pervasive in web content.
Images and other graphical elements within many modern web pages are set as editable elements that can be added to templates and web pages by different team members, such as Marketing, after the core website structures have
been coded. This often leads to situations where images are added by non-technical people who are not required to enter alternative text or are unfamiliar with authoring appropriate alternative text. So, while there&apos;s every reason to expect alternative text in source, it remains missing far too often.
</dd>
<dt>Trade-Offs</dt>
<dd>
	It is reasonable to expect source provided alternative text will be superior in quality. Post-source provided alt likely will not engage the content authors and therefore may fail to properly communicate the functional import of graphical objects.
</dd>
<dt>Benefit</dt>
<dd>
Post-source methods can engage the services of experts in proper alternative text authoring. But, however the alternative text is provided, there&apos;s no longer any excuse for missing alt text.
</dd>

<dt>Automatability</dt>
<dd>
	In many cases&mdash;Alts, as they are static and do not require the <q>state</q> property to be set and checked in the accessibility tree, are among the most likely nodes on the accessibility tree to benefit from post-source
	automation. This includes identifying decorative images missing a <q>null</q> attribute.

<section id="tooltip">
	<h3>Provide Tooltips</h3>

<p>This capability supplies a small pop-up window that appears
on hover to display additional information about an element on the page for users who benefit from enhanced
contextualization or clarification.</p>

<dd>This is an enhancement post-source remediation offers in situations where additional contextualization and status clarification is particularly beneficial for certain users such as screen reader users or for persons living with cognitive or learning disabilities.</dd>
<dt>Benefit</dt>
<dd>
	Supports comprehension for users who require the enhanced support in a manner that does not interfere with the fundamental functionality of the content.
</dd>

<dt>Automatability</dt>
<dd>In many cases&mdash;Automation can generate tooltips for certain elements by leveraging metadata and contextual cues. However, ensuring that tooltips provide meaningful, non-redundant, and contextually relevant
	information requires human oversight, especially in complex interfaces.

	<dd>
		There&apos;s no particular advantage to performing this task post-source.
	</dd>
	<dt>Benefit</dt>
	<dd>
		Content lacking a correct programmatic language declaration will often be incorrectly rendered by <abbr title="Text To Speech">TTS</abbr> for screen reader and read-aloud users. It will inevitably fail for braille users.
	</dd>
	<dt>Automatability</dt>
	<dd>In many cases&mdash;Automated detection can infer the primary language of a webpage using existing metadata or linguistic models. However, in multilingual content or cases where code-level declarations conflict

<dt>Source</dt>
<dd>
	Though there&apos;s every reason to expect appropriate titles will be provided in source, titles are often overlooked or automatically generated by <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr> platforms, leaving them generic, duplicated, or irrelevant. This is common in systems where non-technical team members are responsible for adding new pages or
content.
</dd>
<dt>Trade-Offs</dt>
<dd>
Sometimes the content author may not have prioritized or fully understood the
significance of a page title&apos;s role in accessibility (and <abbr title="Search Engine Optimization">SEO</abbr>).
While post-source remediation typically lacks the content author&apos;s contextual understanding, it can still provide accurate and meaningful title content.
</dd>
<dt>Benefit</dt>
<dd>
Post-source remediation offers a valuable opportunity to audit and enhance page titles as part of a quality assurance process. Applying accessibility expertise after content publication ensures that critical elements
such as page titles are not only present but appropriate to the content.
</dd>
<dt>Automatability</dt>
<dd>
In many cases&mdash;Post-source automation can identify pages with missing or
duplicated titles and insert improvements. However, generating
contextually accurate titles often requires manual input or review to
ensure relevance.

<dt>Trade-Offs</dt>
<dd>The cost of generating human-edited captions is prohibitive, promoting the use of automated captions. However, automation often makes mistakes. 
</dd>
<dt>Benefit</dt>

	Ideally, PDFs are created with accessibility in mind; however, this is not always the case due to lack of awareness, time constraints, or software limitations. Additionally, website or application owners frequently publish

<h1>Presentation&mdash;Usually CSS</h1>

<p>

The capabilities discussed in this section are afforded users to facilitate content rerendering utilizing presentational characteristics each individual user finds most accommodative. These are accommodations that allow users to <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/intro#understanding-the-four-principles-of-accessibility">perceive and understand</a> <a href="#manage">published content and services</a>. For persons with print disabilities, these capabilities starkly illustrate the superior accessibility of web content over printed media, because printed media cannot be similarly accommodating. Whatever <q>look and feel</q> a content provider may have chosen and published, the user&apos;s adaptations must necessarily take precedence for reasons of accessibility. To put it in other words: <q>The author proposes, but the user disposes.</q></p>
<p>We have a strong preference for CSS in presentation rendering because CSS is most fungible. Also, accessibility is natively addressed by W3C&apos;s CSS specifications. Achieving similar results through other technologies leaves the developer directly responsible for all aspects of accessibility in their code. Thus rendering the presentation layer through technologies other than CSS is highly likely to prove inaccessible and require remediation.</p>

There is no particular benefit to to performing this mediation post-source. Overlaying page content with structural markup using post-source technologies is clearly a remedial action to close a critical accessibility gap. On the other hand, and as previously noted, content delivered to end users today is most frequently a composite mashup of multiple input streams and not the simple delivery of content from a single source repository. The very act of mashing together multiple streams introduces a likelihood of semantic incoherency. The very word itself, <q>mashup</q>, strongly suggests a lack of concern for the coherency of the ultimate composite as delivered to the end user. Thus, anything that can be done to introduce greater semantic coherency is of benefit to all users, and especially those users relying on accessibility supporting features such as coherent and explicit structure. Lastly, as also previously noted, emerging strategies to further tailor content interaction to particular users&apos; interaction preferences will rely on good structural markup, and these adaptations will, necessarily, be produced in post-source technologies.

This can save time, especially on long and complex pages with lots of content. By using semantic navigation options like headings or links, sighted users can easily jump to specific sections or pieces of content they are interested in. This can be particularly helpful when users are looking for specific information or trying to locate a particular topic on a page.

		<p>We emphasize that human oversight remains critical to achieve comprehensive accessibility in most situations today. While automation and A-I can help, we should not expect these can replace humans entirely. Human remediation of automatically identified checkpoints, together with the content creator&apos;s active participation to clarify meaning and intent constitutes an effective and efficient approach to accomplish accessibility. 
		</p>

		<dl>
		<dt>Source</dt>
		<dd>
			This is a process approach just as meaningful for remediating accessibility violations in source as it is for remediating post-source. To argue against any remediation <strong>not</strong> done at source or <strong>not</strong> performed by a human, is to argue a theology of accessibility, not a technological solution.
		</dd>
		<dt>Trade-Offs</dt>
		<dd>
			It is clearly preferable to remediate violations in source content whenever feasible. And in-process corrective overlay remediations only make sense when there are good reasons why the source cannot be remediated.

<h2>Post-Source Remediation&mdash;By Site Owner</h2>

		<p> This capability describes an interface or framework made available to
		authorized users within an organization, enabling them
		to develop and deploy accessibility remediating code. It is
		typically used when initial content development did not adequately
		support accessibility or when third-party components and
		content are present. These interfaces may well be limited. For example, limitations may only allow edits of accessibility attributes--such as alt text or
		ARIA labels. A typical limitation  allows edits to
		element-level code, but not the modification of interactive
		components.
		</p>
 
		<dl>
		<dt>Source</dt>
		<dd>
			Where the source lacks sufficient accessibility supporting markup, this capability provides both analytics and remediation access to properly authenticated 
		persons empowered to perform remediation. Organizations with large content teams or distributed contributor communities often find it difficult to enforce consistent accessibility requirements when new content is added or existing content updated. 
 In educational settings, for example, content is often sourced from numerous contributors, each of whom may be
following different styling approaches. Consequently accessibility suffers because it is not a shared responsibility, and the responsibility for ensuring it is fragmented.
		</dd>
		<dt>Trade-Offs</dt>
		<dd>
		Simply relying on post-source remediation may forego an opportunity to further educate (or even require) better accessibility practices at the CMS or web team level. It may also bypass the original
			content creator (or publisher) who typically has the better understanding of the content itself and how best to express its meaning.
When remediation occurs post-source, those
creators may not be involved, potentially leading to less contextually accurate remediations. This observation also explains why A-I remediations are often inadequate and sometimes simply wrong.
		</dd>	 
		<dt>Benefit</dt>
		<dd>
Post-source interfaces can facilitate the addition of missing accessibility markup, providing an alternative to source code updates within the web platform. Equivalent fixes
applied in-source could significantly delay content publication.
This capability exists to assist sites who fail accessibility, usually for a complex set of reasons where in-source remediation is expensive or otherwise not readily achievable. Sometimes, achieving equivalent accessibility  in source requires the publisher to deploy a completely new panoply of content management tooling. While this may be feasible, not everyone wishing to make content available online desires to spend time gaining proficiency with content management systems. 
A dedicated internal accessibility team can monitor and remediate accessibility issues across all content being published on the site&mdash; regardless of its provenance. This enables proactive accessibility enhancement without requiring the many content contributors to adjust their workflows.

<h2>Post-Source Remediation&mdash;By third-party</h2>

<p>This capability extends the above <a href="#a11yedit">Post-Source
	Remediation&mdash;By Site Owner</a> to third parties. Third parties are typically engaged when internal
resources are unavailable or lack sufficient expertise. 
Remediations performed may be broad, and may include updates across all post-source facets including HTML, CSS, and interactive components. The extent and depth
of remediation that can be applied depends on several factors, including the third party&apos;s framework, processes, and the skills of the people involved.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Source</dt>
<dd>
Many factors can contribute to inaccessibility in source content including insufficient knowledge, time, or simply competing priorities among content creators. 
Also, organizations that have not fully embedded accessibility-first processes in their web content publishing workflows often operate in fast-paced environments, where new features and content are launched without accessibility as a formal sign-off requirement. This frequently
leads to inaccessible content and interactive functionality.
Just as authentication and payment processing are often off-loaded to third party services today, it's possible to off-load accessibility support to a competent third-party. A competent third-party will offer both in-source and post-source remediations as they deem most effective.
</dd>
<dt>Trade-Offs</dt>
<dd>
Relying on a third party for post-source remediation creates increased dependency, which means the internal team often loses direct ownership and control over key accessibility fixes. This dependency also introduces the risk that
fixes could override or conflict with other parts of the site&apos;s code, so additional care is needed to check both accessibility and the original site&apos;s functionality during updates. In addition, sustainability
becomes a challenge because post-source fixes are always reliant on the underlying source; so, when the source changes, due diligence is required to ensure that the post-source remediation remains effective and does not fail or
create new accessibility barriers.
Too often the only in-source remediation option is granting third-parties write access. On some sites this may require full administrative access&mdash;a level of access that is both unnecessary and generally unacceptable for security reasons.
</dd>
<dt>Benefit</dt>

Just as post-source authentication and post-source payment processing services help  free a site from ancillary responsibilities, an accessibility specialized third-party remediation service can address both content issues and critical functional barriers.

<h3>Feature-Bundling Profiles</h3>

<p>Site publishers need to support the full spectrum of accessibility features. On the other hand, individual users need certain features and will ignore those they do not need. The types of features individual users need are  often group-able

	By definition intent driven user interface design constitutes the antithesis of today&apos;s design approach.

<section id="portable">
<h3>Configure Once, Use Everywhere</h3>

<p>Users now frequently use several devices. Furthermore, users tend to have the same or very similar accessibility requirements regardless of the device they may be using in the moment. 
	It is therefore an emerging goal in web accommodations to support the user in configuring once and having their configured preference propagate across all their devices. Such a cross-device preference profile should ideally function across all vendors and operating environments.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Source</dt>
<dd>While technically feasible in source, this is not being done by content source today, and we are not aware of any proposals to add such functionality in content source&mdash;likely for a multiplicity of reasons.
	People, regardless of ability or disability, may often want to withhold this information from a source provider, and would certainly not want it to propagate to 
	source providers outside of their knowledge or control.</dd>

<dt>Trade-Offs</dt>

	A privacy-preserving, cross-platform U-I configuring capability is now a <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/vc/WG/Meetings/Minutes/2022-09-15-vcwg#section8">long-term goal in the W3C Accessible Platform Architectures (APA) Working Group.</a> 
	Such a capability has long been desired and is arguably now more achievable than ever before. 
	It would  clearly be valuable to users. 
	For example, blind users and people on slow internet connections will benefit from setting their browsers to not download images. 
	It will nevertheless require nuanced implementation, e.g.  screen size and consequent decisions over preferred fonts, spacing, and contrasts  will likely vary by screen size and environmental conditions.

<h3>Allow Users to Choose Transformations</h3>

<dl>
<dt>Source</dt>
<dd>Users tend to require the same types of accommodations across all sites and all content sources. Therefore, facilitating this capability in-source is likely the least useful place to locate it, because that would require the user to select the same enhancements time and again across the succession of sites visited and likely with different menu organization site to site. </dd>

<dt>Trade-Offs</dt>
<dd>Many of the capabilities made available by user-triggered opt-ins are often also found in multiple places at the edge. For example, contrast adjustment is generally found  in operating system display settings, in browser and app user-agents (e.g. dark mode/light mode), in browser extensions, and in JavaScripted (CDN hosted) overlays. Such redundancy can easily lead to confusion. This confusion may be further exacerbated because certain settings the user finds helpful may be available only in one of these locations, and not in all of them. Furthermore, users are frequently not particularly knowledgeable about their operating system settings menus, especially as these tend to move with each OS revision (to take one example). This can make it difficult to locate these capabilities, especially when we recognize that once satisfactorily configured they are generally not reset&mdash;meaning that the user doesn&apos;t need to revisit that menu location and soon forgets where it is. On the other hand, locating the accommodation consistently proximate to the user offers the highest likelihood of maximal benefit provided  the accommodation  can be easily identified and invoked. This also provides the best opportunity for easing the burden of invoking the same accommodation across a user&apos;s multiple devices.</dd>

<dt>Benefit</dt>
<dd>Users can select, optimally tune, and reuse the types of accommodations that they require.

		<h3>Normalize Control &amp; Content Layout</h3>

And, while individual sites may be fully consistent in where they locate controls on the pages they publish, the user who comparison shops will encounter a different site consistently locating the same controls differently. The publisher has done nothing wrong, but the user is forced to rely on a perfect memory or put up with time-consuming strategies for locating these controls. Consider this example:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The user needs to make a reservation on a travel site and will shop several sites to compare offers.</li>
		<li>Necessarily this involves picking (or specifying) dates.</li>
		<li>Typically, a starting date is specified first.</li>
		<li>At this point the user needs to locate the control for switching to the specification of the end date.</li>
		<li>Where is it on this site? Is it at the upper right? The lower left? Some other location on screen on this particular site which is different from other sites the user has searched?</li>
		<li>Note  that swiping on a touchscreen may easily miss encountering these controls, especially when swiping forward into future dates. Swiping focus will remain in the date-picker widget.</li>
		<li>Searching for these controls risks activating a control irrelevant to the current task such as a notification screen. This further complicates the user&apos;s predicament and wastes yet more of the user&apos;s time.</li>

		<h1>Our Design Principles</h1>

<p>Our approach to design and analysis in this document is rooted in the principles often called: <q>Human-Centered
Design (HCD).</q> As an outlook that places people at its core, we believe HCD  aligns perfectly with the goals of accessibility. This method of design prioritizes empathy, collaboration, and user empowerment, which aligns with
our mission to generate accessibility solutions that meet the diverse needs of various human individuals. Our understanding of HCD requires us to minimize technological configuration tasks and maximize each individual&apos;s ability to read and interact with actual content&mdash;not the application (or browser) <q>chrome.</q></p>

		<p>Among various design terminologies linked with accessibility such as
		<q>universal design</q> and <q>inclusive design,</q> HCD sets itself apart due to some
		specific distinct attributes, such as:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>A Focus on Individual Needs:</strong> HCD underscores the importance of comprehending
		the unique needs, preferences, and behaviors of individual users. It
		acknowledges that effective design solutions must address the broad
		spectrum of the human experience, catering to the specific requirements of
		different individuals. At the same time our goal is to allow individual users to focus on the features that assist them without needing to endlessly scroll through features that are the needs of other individuals.</li>

			<li><strong>User Empowerment:</strong> Central to the HCD approach is the active involvement of
		users throughout the design process. This approach appreciates their
		expertise, insights, and encourages co-creation, thereby fostering a sense
		of ownership and agency over the final outcome. As an example, in developing this document we actively solicit the input of individuals on whose behalf we endeavor to quantify and describe useful accessibility features. As with all W3C documents, transparency and wide public review are core values.</li>
		</ul>

<p>Our design philosophy does not merely aim for inclusivity; instead, it
		strives to create meaningful experiences that significantly enhance the
		lives of the people we serve. A successful application of HCD manifests not
		just in broad-reaching accessibility, but in generating rich, meaningful,
		and transformative experiences for the user.</p>

<p>Furthermore, HCD endeavors to build a comprehensive understanding of the
end user, transcending the confines of mere accessibility. It delves into
the emotional, cognitive, and social dimensions of the human experience,
with a commitment to design solutions that resonate on a profoundly
personal level.</p>

<p>Our commitment to HCD is woven throughout our efforts to ensure
accessibility. In prioritizing a user&apos;s individual needs and emphasizing
their active involvement in the design process, we believe we can create a
more accessible and inclusive digital environment. By employing HCD, we
hope to deliver a seamless, enjoyable experience for all users, that is
more than just accessible - it is truly human-centered.</p>

		<h1>Who&apos;s Responsible for What?</h1>

	<p>The capabilities discussed in this document were originally organized under two primary categories with several subcategories under each primary section conforming with client-server architecture, the backbone of all digital transactions and interactions that take place over the web. These roles are still important to note, so we have preserved our analysis in this Appendix. The primary categories are:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Capabilities the end user can (or should) be able to control fully.</li>
		<li>Capabilities which are necessarily controlled by the content provider even though they can profoundly affect the accessibility experience.</li>
	</ul>

<p>The Content Provider, analogous to the server, plays the pivotal role of specifying and delivering diverse forms of digital content ranging from text, images, audio, video, to interactive elements. They curate the experiences that users consume and engage with, thereby shaping the digital landscape.

A selection of some primary Content Provider roles:
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Role</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Author</td>
    <td>Responsible for generating the primary content, be it text, script for audio/video, or conceptual outlines for interactive elements.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Designer</td>
    <td>Work on the aesthetic aspects of the content including the layout, color scheme, typography, and visual elements. They also handle the user interface and user experience design for interactive content.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Product Owner</td>
    <td>Oversee the overall content creation and distribution project, make key decisions and coordinate between different teams to ensure the final product meets its intended objectives.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Developer</td>
    <td>Implement the designs into functional code. They work on the website or application where the content will be hosted, ensuring its responsive, functional, and accessible. Some write proprietary algorithms, but most call and configure frameworks and libraries written by communities of coders.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Marketer</td>
    <td>Oversee and implement the marketing strategy for the content. They coordinate marketing campaigns and work closely with other teams to ensure the content reaches the desired audience. Growth marketers utilize data-driven marketing techniques to help the business expand its customer base. They use various strategies and tools to attract, engage, and retain users driving critical website requirements.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


<p>On the other end of the spectrum is the End User, or the client, who experiences this digital content. End users span a wide range, varying in their demographic, cognitive, and physical attributes. They also bring to the table their unique needs, preferences, and accessibility requirements. It is for these users that content providers shape their digital content and experiences, with or without the knowledge that the user&apos;
s own hardware and software may render it in ways the Content Provider never imagined. </p>

<P>Content sites are inherently dynamic; they are assembled for the end-user in a mashup, a unique blend of content that can vary significantly from user to user. A selection of some of the hardware, software, tools and technologies that participate in this edge activity include:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Technology</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>User-Agent (Browser)</td>
    <td>Interprets and presents web content to the end user. Different browsers may render web content in different ways due to their different rendering engines.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Assistive Technology</td>
    <td>Devices or software applications that assist individuals with disabilities or impairments. This could include screen readers, alternative input devices, and voice recognition software.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Browser Extension</td>
    <td>An add-on or plugin that extends the functionality of a web browser. Could alter the appearance of web content, block advertisements, or add additional capabilities to a webpage. Includes mashup tools or web services that combine content from more than one source into a single integrated experience. These can greatly modify the original content and how it is presented to the user.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>OS or Software Application</td>
    <td>A program or group of programs running on the local operating system. Applications can vary drastically in purpose, from productivity apps to entertainment apps, and can influence how digital content is accessed and interacted with.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Video/Audio System</td>
    <td>Hardware and software components that control the output of video and sound.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Content Delivery Network</td>
    <td>Store copies of web content in various locations around the world to reduce the physical distance between the server and the user, improving site performance. This intermediary, typically invisible to the end user, plays a critical role in delivery and updating of digital content, as well as authenticating users.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>This two-poled digital communication model is not a one-way broadcast, but a dynamic conversation. Feedback from end users can influence and improve the content generated by providers, while content providers continuously adapt their strategies based on user behavior and needs. The feedback loops become more complex as edge technologies come into play.

		<h3>My Site, Their Service</h3>

				<dd>They typical website today is a platform for interaction, a space where an organization meets its customers.

<h3>What Only The Edge Knows For Sure</h3>

<p>While some rare web pages may yet serve up a single experience like a short order cook handing over a hamburger, most are like the food court at a shopping mall with many independent services rallying to the end user&apos;s needs. Content providers pack their pages with services such as cookie permissions, chat, payment gateways, user-generated reviews, and most prolifically advertisements. Whether these mashups are accessible can only ever be discovered by evaluating the end user&apos;s experience.</p>
	
  <p>Content providers today may guess at an end user&apos;s actual experience by testing a few carefully chosen scenarios. Large organizations may do better and arrange focus groups that give a glimpse of the actual experience of a few users at one moment in time. However, the larger a web presence to be tested is, the more impossible it is to test all possible scenarios prospectively.</p>
  
<p>Edge technologies, on the other hand, are actually well positioned to
identify, quantify, and report on  precisely those accessibility challenges
that end users are experiencing. Furthermore, far more end user experiences can be evaluated and reported by edge technologies than
human testing could ever cover. Gathering and reporting many samples to upstream end points is
arguably the most efficient way to spot anomalous patterns (and a great
application for A-I analysis). Source can only impute what the edge can confidently demonstrate. Regardless the testing approach, only the edge knows for sure whether any particular web content experience can be called <q>accessible.</q></p>
